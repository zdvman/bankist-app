A modern and interactive banking interface built with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. This project simulates a simplified online banking experience where users can log in, view their transactions, transfer money, request loans, and close accounts.

This app showcases advanced array methods, DOM manipulation, internationalization, timers, and clean UI logic.
